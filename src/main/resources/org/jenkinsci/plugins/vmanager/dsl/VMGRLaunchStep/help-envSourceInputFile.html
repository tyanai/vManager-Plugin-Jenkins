<div>
  <strong>Supported by vManager 17.10 and above only</strong></br>
  In case of a need in adding the vsif environment variables, users can create a list of aliases and store them within a file. The job will 'source' that file prior of reading the vsif.</br>
  Note that this can also serve for any pre stage execution, not just for aliases.
  </br>
  Relative path is also supported (aka ~/doSomething.sh).
  </br>
  Script must be in bash.
  </br></br>
  The file should be place into a directory with a read permission for the user who launches the regression.</br> 
  In case this field is empty, this field is ignored</br>
