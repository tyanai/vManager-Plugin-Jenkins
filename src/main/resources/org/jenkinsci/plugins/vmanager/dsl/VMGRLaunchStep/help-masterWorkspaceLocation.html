<div>
  In case of master/nodes setup, in which the job is running on the nodes, the workspace location is of the nodes, not the master.</br>
  The vManager plugins stores run's data at the master location, and as such need to know the full path for the master workspace per build.</br></br>
  Example:</br>
  <strong>
  (pipelineNodes: true, masterWorkspaceLocation: c:/jenkins/workspace) </br>
  </strong>
